# The most basic custom feature renderer I could write

I started from the [template](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-plugin-template) 
and tried to make an svg feature renderer that just renders features as rectangles.

It mostly works, though I could not figure out how to do hover effects across StaticBlocks.
Going to commit this now and then fork it to work on my own renderer.
